The following config files are placed in

~/.config/Code/User on Linux

%APPDATA%\Code\User (C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Code\User) on Windows

~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/ on Mac OS X

The files are settings.json and keybindings.json.

Right now I only have MacOS bindings, they will need to be adjusted to be used on windows.
